## Overview

Cleverlay is a clean, fast, simple media overlay system for Web sites. From photos to video games and more, it provides an easy way for Web sites to present both images and rich media without cluttering pages or requiring page changes.

Cleverlay already supports images and Adobe Flash content. Support for other kinds of content may be added later.
