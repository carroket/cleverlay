# Cleverlay

**A Clean, Fast, Simple Media Overlay System for Web Sites**

## Overview

Cleverlay is a clean, fast, simple media overlay system for Web sites. From photos to video games and more, it provides an easy way for Web sites to present both images and rich media without cluttering pages or requiring page changes.

Cleverlay already supports images and Adobe Flash content. Support for other kinds of content may be added later.

## Availability

Cleverlay is available for download from [GitHub](https://github.com/carroket/cleverlay) free of charge. It is licensed via the standard MIT License.

A more robust and refined version of Cleverlay should soon be available along with correspondingly improved documentation. In the meantime, you are welcome to download and tinker with the work in progress. Star it. Watch it. Fork it if you are so inclined. Knock yourself out.

## Demos
